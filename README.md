# Flask, SQLite, and Markdown

This project is based on a tutorial on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-python-markdown-with-flask-and-sqlite)

Base tutorial is completed. 

## Notes

- config.py needed, but not included in the repository. 
- This has been fun, but the core functionality will be moved to a Django project

## TODO:

- Add ability to edit posts
- Post individual pages
